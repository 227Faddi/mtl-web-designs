## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap.

Started from a Bootstrap template and integrated i18n using [i18nextify](https://github.com/i18next/i18nextify/tree/master) 

## Optimizations

Using [i18nextify](https://github.com/i18next/i18nextify/tree/master) made the internalization faster and more maintainable without requiring any back-end application or using multiple html files

## Lessons Learned:

This project is helping me learn more about design, making things work faster, and making websites look better. I'm getting better at what I know, and I'm finding new tools to help me do even better.

I'm not just learning about the technical stuff; I'm also figuring out how to make customers happy, design things that look good, and handle different clients' needs.
