## Lessons Learned:

This project is helping me learn more about design, making things work faster, and making websites look better. I'm getting better at what I know, and I'm finding new tools to help me do even better.

I'm not just learning about the technical stuff; I'm also figuring out how to make customers happy, design things that look good, and handle different clients' needs.
